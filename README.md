# Google MLKit SwiftPM Wrapper

This is experimental project for building MLKit in Swift Package Manager.

## Requirements

- iOS 14 and later
- Xcode 13.2.1 and later

## Installation

### Use Swift Package Manager to install

```swift
    .package(url: "https://github.com/d-date/google-mlkit-swiftpm", from: "3.2.1")
```

### Add Linker flags

Add these flags to `Other Linker Flags` in Build Settings of your Xcode projects.

- `-ObjC`
- `-all_load`

### Link `.bundle` to your project

The `MLKitFaceDetection` contains `GoogleMVFaceDetectorResources.bundle`. Since the bundle can't be introduced via Swift PM, you need to link to your project by yourself.

Download `GoogleMVFaceDetectorResources.bundle` from [Release](https://github.com/d-date/google-mlkit-swiftpm/releases/download/3.2.0/GoogleMVFaceDetectorResources.bundle.zip) and add to your Xcode project and make it available in your build target.

## Limitation

- Since pre-built MLKit binary missing `arm64` for iphonesimulator, this project enables to build in `arm64` for iphoneos and `x86_64` for iphonesimulator only.
- Only supported `Face Detection` and `Barcode Scanning` right now.

## Example

Open `Example/Example.xcworkspace` and fixing code signing to yours.
